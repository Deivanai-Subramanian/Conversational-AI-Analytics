# Conversational-AI-Analytics

Conversational analytics is essentially analyzing any kind of dialog between your organization and your customers for insights on their experience.
Conversational analytics is the practice of using artificial intelligence, more specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP), to derive data from human conversations with customers and respond appropriately. NLP combines linguistics and computer science to understand human language in all its forms, whether in email, customer support calls, social media interactions, and more. Using conversational analytics, you can analyze thousands of pieces of data and find useful insights present within this data in seconds. For the purpose of analysis, conversation is normally divided into voice data and text data. Within voice data you have things like calls with customer service agents. Text data then includes emails, bot chat transcript feedback, social media conversations and more.

Here, we have created web application using Streamlit framework and Python as backend programming language. We have taken the amazon sales dataset for building advanced dashboard analytics and further voice AI chatbot has been implemented for specific purposes.
